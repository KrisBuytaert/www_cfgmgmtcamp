# Jerakia Day

Please join us on February 6th for the first ever Jerakia Day!

This will be your chance to meet other [Jerakia](http://jerakia.io/) devs and
users, learn more about who they are and what they do, and hopefully do some
work together on the project!

To get a feeling for what we could be up to, please browse through the
projects in the new [Jerkia github organization](https://github.com/jerakia) and
see if you find any interesting bits.

* Jerakia server
* Jerkia clients, client libraries
* Work on our in-progress integrations with Ansible, Terraform
* Discuss use cases
* Bugs, features, maybe even pull requests?

Room and other details TBA, check back on this page later!

Please remember to [register](https://registration.cfgmgmtcamp.be/ghent/2019/)
that you want to join us through the general Config Management Camp registration
system.
